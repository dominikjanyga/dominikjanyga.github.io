## 1. Data collection of polish stock companies using pandas and yfinance libraries.

### Loading libraries.

In the first step, I imported libraries which will be helpful in data scraping and processing. I used `pandas` to read HTML tables from the [Stooq website](https://stooq.pl/), which lists all the components of the WIG index. Additionally, I used the `yfinance` library to obtain financial information on companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE).

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
```

I mount Google Drive in a Google Colab environment. All the future data will be saved in my google drive, making it easy to access and load datasets. 

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### Collecting Ticker Symbols from Stooq

This step involves scraping ticker symbols for companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. By looping through Stooqâ€™s HTML tables, I extract each ticker symbol, which represents a stock listed in the WSE, and save it to a list for later use.

```python
ticker_list = []

for page in range(1, 9):
    page_url = f"https://stooq.pl/q/i/?s=wig&l={page}"
    wig_table = pd.read_html(page_url)[1]
    wig_selected_rows = wig_table.iloc[5:-1, 0].tolist()
    ticker_list.extend(wig_selected_rows)

print(ticker_list)
len(ticker_list)
```
